# ADD
ADD(Anti-Disassembler and Debugger) is a script that makes the disassembly and debugging of a binary much more difficult and complex so that people without powerful resources will not be able to reverse engineer stuff.Indeed this is also a common methodology used by malwares to evade detection.
